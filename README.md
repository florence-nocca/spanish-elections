### Thesis' abstract:
This Masterâ€™s Thesis explores the relations between candidates and parties on social media during the 2015 Spanish general elections campaign. Thanks to this approach, we analyse the impact of new technologies on the territorial organisation of political parties. We base our analysis on a database containing all the tweets posted by the national and regional accounts of the four main Spanish parties and their candidates during the official campaign. We propose three measures of proximity between the candidates and their parties using the wordscores document scaling technique, graph theory and wordclouds. We find that, despite an overall centralisation of the campaign on Twitter, the party still matters to explain candidates/party relationships. More precisely, we identify three types of territorial organisation, on a hierarchy-stratarchy continuum.
