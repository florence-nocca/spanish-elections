# What is spanish-elections?
[spanish-elections](https://github.com/florence-nocca/spanish-elections) is part of my Master's thesis in political science that I am currently writing. 

For my thesis, I examine candidate/party relations on social media during an electoral campaign to analyze the impact of these new technologies on the territorial organization of political parties. My fieldwork is the electoral campaigns for 2015 Spanish general elections on Twitter. Concretely, I am looking at tweets issued by candidates to compare their political/policy positions with those of their political parties, both at the regional and national levels (tweets issued on the regional and the national accounts of the parties plus party manifesto).
